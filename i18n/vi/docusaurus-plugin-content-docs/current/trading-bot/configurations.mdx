- **Strategy**: I picked a simple **Bollinger Band strategy** which places the `LONG` position when close price cross under lower band and `EXIT` position when close price cross over the base line (SMA). In reverse, `SHORT` position when close price cross over upper band and `EXIT` position when close price cross under the base line (SMA).
